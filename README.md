# Project 3: AWS-Cloud-Architect-Project-Cloud-Security-Protecting-Resources-and-Data-in-the-Cloud

In this project, you will:

- Deploy and assess a simple web application environmentâ€™s security posture
- Test the security of the environment by simulating attack scenarios and exploiting cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- Implement monitoring to identify insecure configurations and malicious activity
- Apply methods learned in the course to harden and secure the environment
- Design a DevSecOps pipeline

**Task 1 - Deploy Project Environment**

Deliverables for Exercise 1: E1T4.txt - Text file identifying 2 poor security practices with justification.

**Part 1: Review Architecture Diagram**

In this task, the objective is to familiarize yourself with the starting architecture diagram. An architecture diagram has been provided which reflects the resources that will be deployed in your AWS account.

Insecure Webservice:

![alt text](https://github.com/mikethwolff/AWS-Cloud-Architect-Project-Cloud-Security-Protecting-Resources-and-Data-in-the-Cloud/blob/main/Cloud%20Security%20-%20Protecting%20Resources%20and%20Data%20in%20the%20Cloud/AWS-WebServiceDiagram-v1-insecure-1.png)

Expected user flow:
- Clients will invoke a public-facing web service to pull free recipes.
- The web service is hosted by an HTTP load balancer listening on port 80.
- The web service is forwarding requests to the web application instance which listens on port 5000.
- The web application instance will, in turn, use the public-facing AWS API to pull recipe files from the S3 bucket hosting free recipes. An IAM role and policy will provide the web app instance permissions required to access objects in the S3 bucket.
- Another S3 bucket is used as a vault to store secret recipes; there are privileged users who would need access to this bucket. The web application server does not need access to this bucket.

Attack flow:
- Scripts simulating an attack will be run from a separate instance which is in an un-trusted subnet.
- The scripts will attempt to break into the web application instance using the public IP and attempt to access data in the secret recipe S3 bucket.

**Part 2: Review CloudFormation Template**

In this task, the objective is to familiarize yourself with the starter code and to get you up and running quickly. Spend a few minutes going through the .yml files in the starter folder to get a feel for how parts of the code will map to the components in the architecture diagram.

Additionally, we have provided a CloudFormation template which will deploy the following resources in AWS:

VPC Stack for the underlying network:
- A VPC with 2 public subnets, one private subnet, and internet gateways etc for internet access.
S3 bucket stack:
- 2 S3 buckets that will contain data objects for the application.
Application stack:
- An EC2 instance that will act as an external attacker from which we will test the ability of our environment to handle threats
- An EC2 instance that will be running a simple web service.
- Application LoadBalancer
- Security groups
- IAM role

**Part 3: Deployment of Initial Infrastructure**

In this task, the objective is to deploy the CloudFormation stacks that will create the below environment.

1. We will utilize the AWS CLI in this guide, however, you are welcome to use the AWS console to deploy the CloudFormation templates.

- Make sure that your IDE (preferably VS Code) is integrated with AWS.
- From the root directory of the repository
- Deploy the S3 buckets
- Deploy the VPC and Subnets
- Deploy the Application Stack
- You will need to specify a pre-existing key-pair name. If you don't have a pre-existing key-pair, create a new one in the AWS Console. 

Note: Your key's region must exist in the same region that you plan to deploy your stack.

2. Once you see Status is CREATE_COMPLETE for all 3 stacks, obtain the required parameters needed for the project.

- Obtain the name of the S3 bucket by navigating to the Outputs section of the stack

Note down the names of the two other buckets that have been created, one for free recipes and one for secret recipes. You will need the bucket names to upload example recipe data to the buckets and to run the attack scripts.

- You will need the Application Load Balancer endpoint to test the web service - ApplicationURL
- You will need the web application EC2 instance public IP address to simulate the attack - ApplicationInstanceIP
- You will need the public IP address of the attack instance from which to run the attack scripts - AttackInstanceIP
- You can get these from the Outputs section of the c3-app stack.

3. Upload data to S3 buckets
- Upload the free recipes to the free recipe S3 bucket from step 2. Do this by typing this command into the console (you will replace "BucketNameRecipesFree" with your bucket name)
- Upload the secret recipes to the secret recipe S3 bucket from step 2. Do this by typing this command into the console (you will replace "BucketNameRecipesSecret" with your bucket name)

4. Test the application
Invoke the web service using the application load balancer URL:

```
http://<ApplicationURL>/free_recipe
```
You should receive a recipe for banana bread.

The AMIs specified in the cloud formation template exist in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region. You will need to set this as your default region when deploying resources for this project.

**Part 4: Identify Bad Practices**

Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security. List these 2 practices, and a justification for your choices, in the text file named E1T4.txt.

Deliverables:

E1T4.txt - Text file identifying 2 poor security practices with justification.

**Solution:**
  
E1T4.txt
```
Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

The WebAppSG security group inboud rules are unecessary:

TCP port 80
SSH port 22
All traffic at all ports

We can delete these inbound rules and apply the principle of least privilege. 


# Poor practice 2

The current instance role policy is allowing access from the application server to all S3 buckets, this should be restricted to specific defined buckets only (free receipe).

#Poor practice 2

The security groups' inbound and outbound rules set CIDR to 0.0.0.0/0. which allow unrestricted access to any TCP/UDP ports and should have been restricted access to only those IP addresses that require it in order to implement the principle of least privilege and reduce the possibility of a breach.
```

**Task 2: Enable Security Monitoring**

Deliverables for Exercise 2:

- E2T2_config.png - Screenshot of AWS Config showing non-compliant rules.
- E2T2_inspector.png - Screenshot of AWS Inspector showing scan results.
- E2T2_securityhub.png - Screenshot of AWS Security Hub showing compliance standards for CIS foundations.
- E2T2.txt - Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
 
**Part 1: Enable Security Monitoring using AWS Native Tools**

First, we will set up security monitoring to ensure that the AWS account and environment configuration is in compliance with the CIS standards for cloud security.

**Part 2: Identify and Triage Vulnerabilities**

Please submit screenshots of:

- AWS Config - showing non-compliant rules
- AWS Inspector - showing scan results
- AWS Security Hub - showing compliance standards for CIS foundations.
- Name the files E2T2_config.png, E2T2_inspector.png, E2T2_securityhub.png respectively.
- Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project. Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities. Submit your findings in E2T2.txt

E2T2.txt
```
Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities:

CIS.4.1     Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
CIS.2.9	Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs

TCP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet ...

S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
S3.1 S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled

EC2 EBS default encryption should be enabled
EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address

Recommendations:

Provide specific IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22.
Enable VPC flow logging.

You can edit the Security Groups to remove access from the internet on port ...

Enable default encryption on S3 buckets.

You can use the Amazon EC2 console to enable default encryption for Amazon EBS volumes.
Use a non-default VPC so that your instance is not assigned a public IP address by default.
```

**Task 3 - Attack Simulation**

Now you will run scripts that will simulate the following attack conditions: Making an SSH connection to the application server using brute force password cracking. Capturing secret recipe files from the s3 bucket using stolen API keys.

**Part 1: Brute force attack to exploit SSH ports facing the internet and an insecure configuration on the server**

1. Log into the attack simulation server using your SSH key-pair.
2. Start a brute force attack against the application server. You will need the application server hostname for this.

**Part 2: Accessing Secret Recipe Data File from S3**

Imagine a scenario where API keys used by the application server to read data from S3 were discovered and stolen by the brute force attack. This provides the attack instance the same API privileges as the application instance. We can test this scenario by attempting to use the API to read data from the secrets S3 bucket.

1. Make sure you're still logged into the attack instance and run the following API calls to view and download files from the secret recipes S3 bucket. You will need the name of the S3 bucket for this. Take a screenshot showing the breach: E3T2_s3breach.png

**Task 4 - Implement Security Hardening**

**Part 1 - Remediation plan**

As a Cloud Architect, you have been asked to apply security best practices to the environment so that it can withstand attacks and be more secure.

Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

**Solution**
E4T1.txt
```
# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

Use GuardDuty to identify brute force attacks.
Use AWS WAF to protect resources from common attacks.
Remove ssh login with password - set ssh config PasswordAuthentication to "no"
Take the least-privilege approach and only open the ports needed for communication. Ensure that the operating system is hardened and that unnecessary tools and permissive configurations are disabled.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

Specify the users that can access specific buckets and objects (user policies).
Monitor S3 resources (CloudTrail logs).
Use encryption on S3 bucket objects.
```

**Task 2 - Hardening**

Remove SSH Vulnerability on the Application Instance
1. To disable SSH password login on the application server instance.
2. Test that this made a difference. Run the brute force attack again from Exercise 3, Task 1.
3. Take a screenshot of the terminal window where you ran the attack highlighting the remediation and name it E4T2_sshbruteforce.png.

**Solution**

Apply Network Controls to Restrict Application Server Traffic
1. Update the security group which is assigned to the web application instance. Any method you use to do this is acceptable. The requirement is that we only allow connections to port 5000 from the public subnet where the application load balancer resides.
2. Test that the change worked by attempting to make an SSH connection to the web application instance using its public URL.
3. Submit a screenshot of the security group change and your SSH attempt.
